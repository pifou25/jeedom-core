# Remplacer

**Tools â†’ Replace**

This tool makes it possible to quickly replace equipment and controls, for example in the case of a change of plugin, or of a module.

Like the replacement options on the advanced configuration of a command, it replaces the commands in the scenarios and other, but also allows to transfer the properties of the equipment and the commands.

## Filtres

You can display only certain equipment for more readability, filtering by object or by plugin.

> In the case of a replacement of equipment by equipment from another plugin, select the two plugins.

## Options

## Remplacements

The button **Filter** At the top right allows you to display all the equipment, following the filters by object and by plugin.

For each equipment :

- Check the box at the beginning of the line to activate its replacement.
- Select on the right the equipment by which it will be replaced.
- Click on its name to see its commands, and indicate which commands replace them. When choosing a device, the tool pre-fills these choices if it finds a command of the same type and same name on the target device.

> **Remark**

> When you indicate a target device on a source device, this target device is disabled in the list.
