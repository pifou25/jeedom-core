# Unifi Protect plugin

# Description

Plugin to connect Jeedom to Unifi Protect

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> There is no official API for Unifi protect the plugin can therefore stop working overnight following an update of Unifi protect. Under no circumstances can Jeedom be held responsible and / or have the duty to correct

# Plugin configuration

After installing the plugin, you just need to activate it. Some parameters must be entered in the plugin configuration :

- **Unifi protect controller** : You have to put the path to your Unifi controller (just the IP in most cases)
- **Unifi protect user** : Indicate here a local user name (admin)
- **Unifi protect password** : Enter the user's password here
- **Refresh rate** : Frequency of information requests to the controller (the lower it is, the more resources it will consume on it, beware of those on UDM-Pro)
- **Do not collect events** : Do not recover the events from the cameras (allows to consume less resources but you lose the detection of movement / person / car /...)
- **Find Unifi protect equipment** : Starts synchronization with Unifi Protect

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> If you have the camera plugin installed the Unifi Protect plugin will automatically create the cameras in the camera plugin
